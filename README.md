Ruby script that lets you batch-convert files to mp3 with ffmpeg

Not much to say here. If you have Ruby (tested with 2.3.1) and ffmpeg (tested with 2.8.11) installed, you can batch-convert files to mp3 using this script. Script might be Linux-specific, I don't really know. I'm not a good programmer lol. Use at your own risk.
